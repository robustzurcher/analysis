This file contains the instructions for running the analysis on my econ thesis.

- analysis should be on the latest commit of the branch econ_thesis

- submodules/ruspy should be on the latest commit of branch kantevorich
  (Commit message: Fixing rtd.)

- subomodules/zurcher_data should be on the latest commit of branch polishing_data
  (Commit message: New draft.)

- submodules/robupy should be on the latest commit of master


If everything is set up, please go into folder python and run:

"python replication_script.py"

For best performance I would need at least 100 cores and more than 8GB of Ram.
